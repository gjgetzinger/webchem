\title{Retrieve retention indices from NIST}
\usage{
nist_ri(
  cas,
  type = c("kovats", "linear", "alkane", "lee"),
  polarity = c("polar", "non-polar"),
  temp_prog = c("isothermal", "ramp", "custom")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cas}{CAS numbers either as numeric or formatted correctly with hyphens.}

\item{type}{Retention index type. One of \code{"kovats"}, \code{"linear"},
\code{"alkane"}, or \code{"lee"}. See details for more.}

\item{polarity}{Column polarity. One of "polar" or "non-polar"
to get RIs calculated for polar or non-polar columns.}

\item{temp_prog}{Temperature program. One of "isothermal", "ramp",
or "custom".}
}
\value{
a table of literature RIs with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item{\code{CAS} is the CAS number}
\item{\code{type} is the column type, e.g. "capillary"}
\item{\code{phase} is the stationary phase (column phase)}
\item{\code{RI} is retention index}
\item{\code{length} is column length in meters}
\item{\code{gas} is the carrier gas used}
\item{\code{substrate}}
\item{\code{diameter} is the column diameter in mm}
\item{\code{thickness} is the phase thickness in Âµm}
\item{\code{program}. various columns depending on the value of
\code{temp_prog}}
\item{\code{reference} is where this retention index was published}
\item{\code{comment}. I believe this denotes the database these data
      were aggregated from}
}
}
\description{
This function scrapes NIST for literature retention indices
 given CAS numbers as an input.
}
\details{
The types of retention indices included in NIST include Kovats
 (\code{"kovats"}), Van den Dool and Kratz (\code{"linear"}), normal alkane
 (\code{"alkane"}), and Lee (\code{"lee"}). Details about how these are
 calculated are available on the NIST website:
